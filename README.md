Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

A Python-based project to securely hide messages within images using steganography techniques.
🔹 Overview

This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt secret messages within images using pixel manipulation. It ensures secure data hiding without altering the visible appearance of the image.
📌 Features

✅ Secure Data Hiding – Embeds text inside an image without noticeable changes.
✅ Passcode Protection – Decryption requires a password for security.
✅ Image Processing – Uses pixel modification for data encoding.
✅ Lightweight & Efficient – Works with standard image formats like JPG & PNG.
🛠️ Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, OS

📥 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries using:

pip install opencv-python numpy

2️⃣ Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/SSRachna/Cyber-Security.git
cd Cyber-Security

🔐 How It Works
🔵 Encryption Process

    Run encrypt.py.
    Enter the secret message & passcode.
    The message gets hidden inside the image.
    The encrypted image is saved as encryptedImage.jpg.

🟢 Decryption Process

    Run decrypt.py.
    Enter the correct passcode.
    The hidden message is extracted and displayed.
